# My Projects 

Welcome to **My Projects**!  
This repository is a collection of all the projects I’ve built — some inspired by what I’ve learned, and others born from my own ideas. It's a space where learning meets creativity.

## What's Inside?

This repo contains:
**Learning-based Projects** – Applications developed as part of my journey in learning programming, frameworks, and tools.
**Original Ideas** – Projects that reflect my thinking, experiments, and innovations.

Each folder represents a different project with its own documentation and source code.

##  Goals of This Repository

- Practice what I learn through hands-on coding.
- Develop creative and meaningful applications.
- Track my growth and progress over time.

##  Tech Stack

Some of the technologies I’ve used across these projects:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Python, Flask
- Bootstrap
- SQLite
- More to come as I explore!
